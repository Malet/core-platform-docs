## Core Platform Documentation

Welcome to the [Core Platform](https://www.cecg.io/core-platform/) Documentation!

Core Platform is your ultimate all-in-one developer platform designed to turbocharge your software development journey from Day 1.

These docs assume you've already deployed a full set of Core Platform Environments. If you haven't 
please go to [Core Platform](https://www.cecg.io/core-platform/) to get in touch with us to set up
your environments.

## Getting started

- Want to deploy a new application? See [Deploying Applications](./app)
- Want a full reference for how to use implement Continuous Delivery? See [Path to Production](./p2p)
- Are you operationally responsible for the platform? See [Platform Operations](./platform)
