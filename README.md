# Core Platform Documentation

This repository contains assets to build and run the Core Platform documentation.

## Building Locally

This uses docker:

```bash
make run-local
```

Then access the docs [here](http://localhost:8080)

For fasterfeedback you can install [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) locally then run:

```
hugo serve
```
